# fossilsdb1
## Project Description
This final project set out to modify the Django admin interface to produce a new database/application cataloguing the hominin fossil and primate casts housed in the Anthropology Department. For the purpose of this final project and with the time constraints of the semester, I present the database administrative page and the source code associated with it. In this project, I present source code that allows the user to input data directly through the admin page or file import, code to export all input data, and create models for display. The source code for settings.py can be found in the fossilsdb1 directory, admin.py in the casts directory, and models.py in the casts directory. Through this project I learned how to use Django, PyCharm, and GitHub. A further implication for this project is to set up and run a public facing page for departmental use.
